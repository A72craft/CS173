### 1.2b
>For any integers p and q,${(p+q)}^2$ = $p^2$ +$q^2$

Let p = 2 and q = 2

Thus ${(p+q)}^2$ is $4^2$ = 16 

$p^2$ + $q^2$ = $2^2$ + $2^2$ = 8

16 $\not =$ 8

Therefore the claim For any integers p and q,${(p+q)}^2$ = $p^2$ +$q^2$ is false

### 1.2c
>For any real numbers w, x, y, and z, if w < x and y < z then $wy < xz.$

Let w = -10,  y = -10, x = 1, z = 2

wy = 100, xz = 2

100 > 2

Therefore the claim For any real numbers w, x, y, and z, if w < x and y < z then $wy < xz.$ is false
